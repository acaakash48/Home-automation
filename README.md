Home-automation
===============

Arduino controlled gsm based automation system for home electricity switchimg and control.

Everyone today wants something tha is mobile and techie as well. So far many attempts have been made in the field of automation, but nothing is 
as simple as this project which brings a scenario of highly user-friendly platform called Aarduino.

this project deals with the infra-red signals sent by any remote control(DVD players, TV, etc.) which triggers your desired 
digital pin either HIGH  or LOW. 
And thus, we can control almost anything..

we can use electromagnetic relay swithes, FETs or reed relays to trigger your home appliances and morover you can connect the 
finalized circuitry to your room's switch board and wirelesly control the swithes via your remote control
